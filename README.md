# Torch module for Foundry VTT

This module provides a HUD toggle button for turning on and off a configurable radius of bright and dim light around you. This base function works regardless of game system. 

Additionally, in D&D5e only:
*  The single HUD control will trigger the 'Dancing Lights' cantrip if you have it.
*  Failing that, it will perforrm the 'Light' cantrip if you have that.
*  Failing that, if you have torches, it consumes one, decrementing the quantity on each use.
*  The button will show as disabled when you turn on the HUD if you have no torches left. (It doesn't currently disable the button while the HUD remains open, though, after you have extinguished your last remaining torch. Room for improvement.)

## History

This module was originally written by @Deuce. After several months of no activity, @lupestro eventually submitted the PR to get its features working reliably in FoundryVTT 0.8. After control transferred to the League, the PR was approved. The module is now somewhat actively maintained by @lupestro.
